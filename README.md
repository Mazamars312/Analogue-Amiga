#Commodore Amiga 500

The Commodore Amiga 500 was a personal computer that replaced the well loved Commodore C64 in Commodores product line. It also was one of the many 68K personal computers that showed that this CPU was a power house when intergrated with great hardware beside it.

This is powered from the Mister line of the Amiga Mist project (Also known as the minimig) and the picorv32 RISC-v chip for the media arbitor between the core and APF framework for floopy, harddrive and CDrom access.
