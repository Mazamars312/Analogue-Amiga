# Analogue Pocket - Commodore Amiga 500 - 0.0.5 Alpha

The Commodore Amiga 500 was a personal computer that replaced the well-loved Commodore C64 in the Commodore product line. It also was one of the many 68K personal computers that showed that this CPU was a powerhouse when integrated with great hardware beside it.

This is based on the Mister Github of the Amiga Mist project (Also known as the minimig) and the VexRISCV RISC-v chip for the Media Processing Unit (MPU) between the core and APF framework for floppy, hard drive and CDrom access.

## What can it do?
* Both 68K and 68020 CPUs
* Chip memory 512k, 1m, 1.5m and 2m
* Slow memory none, 512k, 1m, 1.5m
* Fast memory of none/2/4/8Mbyte for the 68000K CPU
* Fast memory of 16/32Mbyte for the 68020K CPU setup - This is experamental at this moment
* AGA Chipset
* Turbo boot
* It can only read ADF disk images (Floppy disks). Writes will come soon with Hard Drive access.

## How to setup
* Place your ADF floppy images in the \asset\amiga\common folder
* Place the kickstart BIOS rom in the \asset\amiga\common folder (I'm using the 1.2 for now, but any original 256/512/1024kbyte firmware rom will work - no encrypted BIOSes yet). Name it to kickstart.rom to autoload it
* Make sure that the \asset\amiga\Mazamars312.amiga\ Folder has the mpu.bin file - this is supplied and should already be there.
* When changing system configurations, you must select the "CPU reset" in the menu to apply the config.

## Is the best way to play this using the dock?

* Yes, as you can then fully use the Keyboard and mouse to interface the core. Just make sure you select in the Port1/Port2 as Mouse/Joystick1 or Mouse/CD32 when using the real mouse.
* Just know that you will need a controller to access the Menu if you want to make changes

## Menu Listing
* Load Bios - This will allow you to reload new BIOS's on the fly - will cause a reset
* Load Floppy Drive 0-3 - This will allow you to load different floppies while playing
* CPU Reset - This will reset the core and any settings changed below it will be applied
* Installed Floppy Drives - this will allow you to select  how many drives are installed and delimit the transfer rate of the amiga core to them.
* Mouse Speed - this will change the update rate of both the emulated and real mouse movements
* Screen Movement x/y - Moves the screen around
* System config - Allows you to select PAL/NTSC refreash, OG (Orginal) hardware or the AGA (Advance Graphics) hardware, Turbo boot or standard boot modes
* CPU Type - Allows you which type of CPU you want installed 68K, 68010, 68020 with no cache, 68020 with cache
* Memory Chip - Size of the Chip memory
* Memory Slow - Size of the slow memory 
* Memory Fast - on the 68000 CPU this is none/2/4/8Mbytes, on the 680X0 this is none or 32 at this moment.

## Is there an emulated mouse while not connected to the dock?

* Yes, Press both the left and right triggers, and the dpad becomes the movement and the buttons are emulated on buttons A,B,X. However, they are as follows â€“ B for the left click, A for the Right click and X for the middle. For me, it just felt better when in this mode but I will look at interaction menu to change this.
* Please note that you have to have the Port1/Port2 setup as Mouse/Joystick1 or Mouse/CD32 for the mouse to work

## Is there an emulated Keyboard?

* Not at this moment, This is up for the next build as I have not decided on the best way to do this yet.

## Can we write to floppy disks at this moment?

* No, I have the code ready, but I want to check it before releasing it.

## When are writable disks and Harddrives going to be working?

* Now that the framework for the MPU has been built, this is a matter of getting the C++ code working with the MPU and APF interface.

## Wait, you have another CPU in the FPGA???

* Yes, the MPU is a VexRISCV CPU configured with a small footprint to interface with the APF interface to the HPS bus currently in the MiSTer Amiga core.

Specs:
* Running at 74.2mhz (Same as the APF bus)
* Connected to the core via a 16bit HPS Bus 
* Two timers - one for interrupts and the other for user timing.
* Currently, 32K of memory/ram for the MPU's program (Will be set to 16K for a smaller footprint)
* A 2Kbyte swap buffer for both the APF and MPU to do transfers


## In the future:
* A separate GitHub for the MPU and the APF framework for other developers to use soon with documentation and how to build with it.

## I have selected a disk that is taking some time to load?

* So it could be due to the game loading still. That's what that excellent green indicator at the top left-hand side is for :-) 
* Try only using one disk drive - I have found that some games don't like having more than one floppy drive unless those drive a operating too.
* I need to build double buffering in the code, as I will use the APF target bus commands to transfer DMA data while processing data to the core simultaneously. Right now, these are two concurrent processes so this does cause some slow down

## Why are some of the resolutions not correct?

* I need to see the standard resolutions to ensure the scaler will work correctly - Interlacing is one thing I need to build up.
* Due to memory access, the RTG resolutions will not work on this right now.

## I have game X that does not work!!!

* From the testing I have been doing, there are multiple configurations, bios and even ADF Images that you need to try. Hopefully, once I get both writing to floppy and the Harddrive access working, this will help with this. 
* The main goal of this project was getting an MPU Framework so external media can be accessed and help giving developers some tools to help create more cores on the Pocket. 
* So I do expect that there is more to learn about the amiga and get many of these bugs resolved.

## What will be the next update??

* First Ill be updating some of the Neogeo core before doing the next lot of updates on this core.
* Then I want a Virtual Keyboard to help non-dock users to be able to play this while on the go.
* Writable Floppy access
* HDF Hard drives - Will we get all 4 working would be a interesting acheavement. However they will only be 4GB max in size due to the APF framework
* Change or separate the mouse rate for both the emulated mouse and real mouse. Right now this value is used on both of them but decreasing the value will make the emulated mouse move slower but the real mouse move faster. 
* An extra 32Mbytes of Fast Ram for the 68020 CPU using the CRAM.
