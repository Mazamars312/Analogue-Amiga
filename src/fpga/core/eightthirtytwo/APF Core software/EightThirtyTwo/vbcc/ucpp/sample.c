/*
 * Sample code showing how to use ucpp as an integrated lexer.
 * This file is public domain.
 */

/*
 * This is an example of how to use ucpp as a preprocessor and lexer
 * into another project. The steps are those described in ucpp README
 * file. To use this code, compile the ucpp source files with
 * STAND_ALONE not defined, and link them with this code. The resulting
 * binary will take a C source file as standard input, preprocess it,
 * and output each non-whitespace token on stdout, with its numerical
 * value (defined as an enum in cpp.h) and its contents. This code
 * defines no system include path.
 *
 * This code supposes that the ucpp files are compiled with PRAGMA_TOKENIZE
 * enabled (see the tune.h file).
