INTRODUCTION

    vprof is a portable utility to visualize the profiling informations,
    which are usually stored in the file "mon.out".
    It shows the percentage of total time spent in a function, the
    total time in seconds, the number of function calls and the time
    by call in ms.


LEGAL

    vprof is freeware.


USAGE

    vprof [mon.out]

    If the profiling file has another name than "mon.out", you may
    specify it as an argument to vprof.

    Some vbcc code generators are able to create profiling information
    by compiling with the -prof option (vbccm68k, for example).


BUGS

    The percentage column is still not working and will always
    display "n.a.".
