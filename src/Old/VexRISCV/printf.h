// \brief Tiny printf, sprintf and (v)snprintf implementation, optimized for speed on
//        embedded systems with a very limited resources. These routines are thread
//        safe and reentrant!
//        Use this instead of the bloated standard/newlib printf cause these use
//        malloc for printf (and may not be thread safe).
