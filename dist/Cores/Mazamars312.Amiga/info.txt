The Amiga Core - Alpha core 0.1.0

The Amiga core is a general implementation of the Amiga family of computers.

To Be Done:
* Clock
* USB Mouse support on the dock
* Fix up the video output on the dock, Will look into this more after Analogue confirms some things.
* and code tidy up - So much to do!!!

Special Thanks
* VexRISCV - For the bases of the MPU for this core
* Boogerman for some coding questions - You still owe me on the use of my jtag tho LOL
* MIST, Mister, DeMistiFy and minimig communities
* And Amiga Vision As well for the Images
